stride = dolžina koraka
biopython
- depth: how many different kernels (and biases) will be convolved with the output of the previous layer; 
- height and width of each kernel
- stride: by how much we shift the kernel in each step to compute the next pixel in the result. 
  This specifies the overlap between individual output pixels, and typically it is set to 1, corresponding to the formula given before. Note that larger strides result in smaller output sizes.
